            I'm goin' away to Illinois
            I'm goin' away to Illinois
            I'm worried now, but I won't be worried long
            My rider got somethin', she's tryin'a keep it hid
            My rider got somethin', she's tryin'a keep it hid
            Lord, I got somethin' to find that somethin' with

            I feel like choppin', chips flyin' everywhere
            I feel like choppin', chips flyin' everywhere
            I've been to the Nation, Lord, but I couldn't stay there
            Some people say them oversea blues ain't bad
            (Why, of course they are)

            Some people say them oversea blues ain't bad
            (What was a-matter with 'em)
            It must not a-been them oversea blues I had
            Every day seem like murder here
            (My God, I'm no sheriff)

            Every day seem like murder here
            I'm gonna leave tomorrow, I know you don't bid my care
            Can't go down any dirt road by myself
            Can't go down any dirt road by myself
            (My Lord, who ya gonna carry?)
            I don't carry mine, gonna carry me someone else
